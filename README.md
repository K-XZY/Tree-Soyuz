# Tree-Soyuz
Tree Climbing Robot (Soyuz) for the Year 1 final project of UCL RAI. This repo consists 2 programs, `main.cpp ` and `P_main.cpp`. The `main.cpp` is the code used for the final trial. The `P_main.cpp` is an implementation using a proportion controller which is intended to decrease the speed gradually when approaching the top of the tree. However, the change in speed was not obvious when deploying this code on our robot, hence `P_main.cpp` was not used for the final trial.

## How to use the code:
Whether you are using Platform IO or Arduino IDE, follow the following steps:<br>
**1. Select the appropriate Arduino Board**, e.g. Arduino MK ZERO for our specific implementation.<br>
**2. Paste the code `main.cpp` into `src` folder of your project**. If you are using Arduino IDE, you can just open the `main.cpp` via Arduino IDE.<br>
**3. Compile and Upload the code into your Arduino board**.<br>
